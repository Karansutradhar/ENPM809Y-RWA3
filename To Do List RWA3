To Do list:
1. Checking if need of deep copy constructors for each class.
2. Done the comments for landbasedrobot, checking that and doing it for other classes.
3. Writing UIDs of authors
4. Comments and checking whether follows Google norms/definitions.
5. Creating Doxy file and documentation.
6. Recheck and modifying if needed.

Update: 24th April 2020: 7AM (Sudharsan):
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

  So Far:
    1. Added comments to the following files
        -> landbasedrobot.cpp
        -> landbasedtracked.h
        -> landbasedtracked.cpp
        -> landbasedwheeled.h
        -> landbasedwheeled.cpp
        -> main.cpp(partial)
        
    2. Modified the output message for the following files
        -> landbasedrobot.cpp
        -> landbasedtracked.cpp

  Notes:
    1. I don't think we need a deep copy constructor I thought about it while creating
      the initial files in the branch, given no pointers in the any of the three classes
      there is no need for a deep copy constructor.
    2. I believe improvements to constructor can be looked into, for naming conventions
      I modified few but if someone can verify the correctness that would be great.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

  Further:
  1. Doxy file generation and check on commenting for all files
  2. Verification on naming standards and conventions as per Google norms/definitions.
  3. Writing UIDs of authors
